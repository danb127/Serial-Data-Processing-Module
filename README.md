### üìñ Project Overview:
Embark on an exploration into digital design with the Serial Data Processing Module project. This endeavor leverages the power of VHDL alongside the robust Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA to create a module capable of performing sophisticated serial data processing operations. This repository serves as your comprehensive guide to the design, simulation, implementation, and demonstration stages of this project.

### üóÇ Repository Structure:
- **src/**: Contains all VHDL source files vital to the project's core functionality.
- **doc/**: Documentation and reports detailing every phase of the project, from conception to realization.
- **sim/**: Simulation files and testbenches, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the design.
- **project/**: The Vivado project file (.xpr), bringing together all elements of the design environment.

### üìò Documentation:
Our documentation dives into the project's heart, offering insights into the operational specifics and design decisions. It encompasses everything from the initial specifications to detailed implementation notes, providing a solid foundation for understanding the project's intricacies.

### üîß Setup and Execution Guide:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine to access all necessary files.

2. **Opening the Project in Vivado**: Navigate to the `project/` directory and open the `.xpr` file with Vivado to set up your workspace.

3. **Simulation**: Utilize Vivado's simulation tools to run the provided testbenches, ensuring the design meets the expected outcomes.

4. **Synthesis and Implementation**: Follow Vivado's workflow to synthesize the design and implement it on the FPGA, adjusting as necessary based on synthesis reports.

5. **Bitstream Generation and FPGA Programming**: Generate the bitstream and program your FPGA board, bringing the design to life.

6. **Demonstration and Evaluation**: Test the system's functionality against the project specifications, using provided or custom test scenarios.
